-Test thoroughly if every streamlit widget/command/syntax work properly and seamlessly.
Most basic widgets/commands/syntaxes already work, but there might be issues to adress with some special ones.

-Improve thread communication logic with events (a piled callable from the python interpreter must be streamed as soon as possible for the rest of the code to be able to use its value without encountering an error)

-Comment the code : Lazy me !

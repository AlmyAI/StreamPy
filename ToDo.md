-Test thoroughly if every streamlit widget/command/syntax work properly and seamlessly.
Most basic widgets/commands/syntaxes already work, but there might be issues to adress with some special ones.

-Adress the "missing widget bug" appearing in some cases.

-Implement automatic key attribution for compatible widgets in case the user doesn't provide any (Will avoid weird widget's behavior)

-Use a special components.py module to ease implementing new streamlit components.
